# Text Summarization with Pretrained Models: BART, Pegasus, and SimpleT5

This repository showcases an in-depth exploration of text summarization techniques applied to a dialogue dataset using three distinct pre-trained models: BART, Pegasus, and SimpleT5. The primary objective of this analysis is to demonstrate the effectiveness and comparative performance of these models in generating concise and informative summaries from dialogues.

Methodology:

Model Implementation:
BART: Utilizes the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) pre-trained model.
Pegasus: Leverages the Pegasus model, known for its abstractive text summarization capabilities.
SimpleT5: Implements SimpleT5, a versatile T5-based model, for text summarization tasks.

Summarization Process:
Demonstrates the application of each pre-trained model for text summarization on the dialogue dataset.
Details the methods used to preprocess the dialogues and generate summaries using these models.

Comparative Analysis:
Conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of the summarization outputs from BART, Pegasus, and SimpleT5.
Evaluates the quality of summaries based on coherence, informativeness, and relevance to the original dialogues.

Contents:

Dataset: Contains the dialogue dataset used for text summarization tasks.

Notebooks/Scripts: Includes code files or notebooks illustrating the implementation and usage of BART, Pegasus, and SimpleT5 for text summarization.

Results and Evaluations: Showcases the generated summaries by each model and evaluates their performance using metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) for summarization quality assessment.

Conclusion:

This repository serves as a comprehensive study of text summarization techniques employing BART, Pegasus, and SimpleT5 models on a dialogue dataset. The comparative analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each pre-trained model for generating concise and informative summaries from dialogues.
